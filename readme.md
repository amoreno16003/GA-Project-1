Technology Used:

Javascript was used for DOM Manipulation, alogithim, creating class objects for everything that is rendered in, 2d ctx,
HTML was used for page layout and different screens depending on the user's touch
CSS was used for styling backgrounds, centering, visually appealing pages, using grid to create the space for the game

Approach Taken:
I took a three step-plan to create this project
1. Create the working mechanics needed for the game (all the JS)
2. Create the styling for all the pages
3. Add custom pictures/characters
